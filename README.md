PDFs of MATH 345 lecture notes with Prof. Wayne Nagata taken at UBC from January-April 2015. Notes were handwritten by myself using a tablet based on what Prof. Nagata wrote on the board and discussed during lectures. I was a (paid) notetaker with Accessibility Services.

My notes for 5 March were based off another student's (Brian Merchant's) notes for that lecture as I was not present (I think I might've been doing a prospective grad student visit).

Based on some email correspondence (kept anonymous for privacy reasons), there may or may not be some errors in the lecture notes for 22 January and 24 March.

22 January:
"in the notes on January 22, at the bottom I have the normal form written for the bead on a hoop. The equation should be dphi/dt = (gamma-1)*phi - phi^3/2 since b=-1/2"

24 March:
"what [do] the 6 diagrams represent from page 4 of the march 24th notes? I think the left ones are f2 and the right ones are f, but your axes are labelled x and y for the left and x and x' on the right."
"You're right about the axes. I'm not sure why they were labelled that way. The left is f2 and the right is f1."
